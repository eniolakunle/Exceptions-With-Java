___
While updating dinosaur data, invalid values could sometimes be provided. Write an
updateDinosaurWeight method that takes a weight value and a Dinosaur object. If
the weight value is less than zero, the method should throw IllegalArgumentException.
Use a try-catch block to handle this exception. The handling can be a simple System.out.
println for now
